        API is how apps/services 'talk' to each other over a network. REST
        (representational state transfer) refers to a design an API must follow
        to be able to interact with others. API's are considered RESTFUL when:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is an exchange of request and response from client to server
        </li>
        <li>
          The data exchange must be able to be manipulated using HTTP Requests
          (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) which refers to CRUD:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Create</li>
          <li>Read</li>
          <li>Update</li>
          <li>Delete</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Node.js is a runtime environment that let's us use JavaScript (a website
        script language) on the backend or the server. It is often used for
        building server-side apps because it is single threaded and of it's
        asynchronous nature. This makes node.js very fast as it does not have to
        stop and wait for a task to finish before going to the next one, instead
        it puts time intensive tasks on the side and picks it back up when it is
        ready.
      </li>

        Express.js is unopinionated, which makes it very flexible as it does not
        restrict users to conform to a predefined structure. On top of this,
        Express comes with useful features for creating web servers such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Routing</li>
          <li>Middleware</li>
          <li>Templating</li>
          <li>Static File serving</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Middleware in Express are essentially functions that can be executed at
        different points of the request-response cycle. It is used for various
        tasks, such as modifying the request or response object, it can be used
        for authentication, logging, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). They
        are normally used by being passed as an argument in app.use()
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            GET is the verb for requesting data form a server, this is read
            only. In the context of RESTful API, GET is the only one that
            renders a 'view' back to the clients. This refers to Index, New,
            Edit, Show in our 'INDUCES Actions'.
          </li>
          <li>
            POST sends new data to the server. POST requests 'create' new data
            entries in RESTful routing
          </li>
          <li>
            PUT is a method for updating an specific existing data. Normally
            used for changing the whole data itself. In RESTful API this
            corresponds to the Update.
            <em
              ><span
                >(It can create the data if the data was not found, can we use
                this intentionally or should it be avoided?)</span
              >></em
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            PATCH is similar to PUT but only requires partial data, and only
            changes the data it was sent with as opposed to the whole data.
          </li>
          <li>
            DELETE is used for deleting a specific data. This corresponds to
            'destroy' in RESTful API.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        To handle parameters in the URL, we can handle them in our routes by
        placing placeholders. <br />
        app.get('/username/:photos', (req, res) => {} ) <br />
        In this example, we used :photos as placeholder for the parameter in our
        URL, we can capture it's value by using <em>req.params.photo</em>. Once
        we have that we can modify our logic accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some of the approaches when it comes to error handling in express.js are
        :
        <ul>
          <li>
            We can create our own error handling middleware/function and pass it
            four args app.use((err, req, res, next) => {} ).
            <em>This must be defines last, AFTER all the other middleware</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            Express also comes with it's own error handling both for sync and
            async code. Errors from sync code are process right there and then
            by express if it is 'thrown'. We must 'catch' errors from async code
            and sent it to express to be processed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        To parse incoming body requests when using express.js we can make use of
        express' built in middleware. One of which is .json() , which turns json
        data sent to the server available for us through req.body (body property
        of the request object)
      </li>
      <li>
        To implement testing with a RESTful API built with NODEjs and Express,
        we can use jest and supertest. Jest is a library/ module used for
        testing and Supertest is used to help us send http requests to test the
        endpoints of our APIs. <br />
        <code>
          const request = require('supertest') <br />
          const { app, server } = require('../app') <br />
          <br />

          describe('Test the root path', () => { <br />
          ..test('It should respond with "Hello World!"', async () => { <br />
          ....const response = await request(app).get('/'); <br />
          ....expect(response.text).toBe('Hello World!'); <br />
          ....expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200); }); <br />
          });
          <br />
          <br />

          afterAll(done => { <br />// Closing the connection allows Jest to exit
          successfully. <br />
          ..server.close() <br />
          ..done() <br />
          })
        </code>

        This code snippet shows how one might test for the root path ('/') of
        their application. describe() contains the description of the test being
        done, followed by a callback function to test() which tells us what we
        are testing for, and inside contains expected values/outputs.
